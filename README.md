# Cell Combiner

An application to combine rectangular cells in a 2D grid.

The cells have different widths and heights, but all cells in a row have the same height and all cells in a column have the same width.

The cells in a combination must be adjacent to at least one other cell in the combination, must contain a specified starter cell, must be no wider or higer than specified maximums, and exclude specified forbidden cells.
